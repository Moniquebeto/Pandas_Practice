# Pandas_practice
Beginner level practice pandas. Contains similar exercise from DataFrames practice. Please keep in mind, I could not find the same csv document, so I developed or find a similar document and follow the youtube video explanation. So in practice is the same, but you will get different values.

The video tutorial is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtjxAH8uaP0&list=PLMeYri-m7zwtAxahXB66uTTfrVo0OFo-W&index=11&t=5s

Please remeber to add the csv file path at the beginning of the code, so the python file can access and read the document.

If you find any mistake or ways to improve it, lets share it. I am also learning python (super beginner level)
