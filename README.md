# Words_Pandas_practice
Beginner level practice pandas. Contains similar exercise from DataFrames practice: working with English Words in datawars. Please keep in mind, I could not find the same csv document, so I developed a similar document and follow the youtube video explanation. So in practice is the same, but you will get different values.

The video tutorial is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtjxAH8uaP0&list=PLMeYri-m7zwtAxahXB66uTTfrVo0OFo-W&index=11&t=5s

Please remeber to add the csv dile path at the beginning of the code, so the python file can access the read the document.

If you find any mistake or ways to improve it, lets share it. I am also learning python (super beginner level)
